# Embedded Dockerfiles

These were original in my docker_recipes repo, but it's growing, and this removes a directory for me to type.

These are Dockerfiles that build various things you need for embedded Linux. So, things like:
 - crosstool builder
 - kernel builders
 - yocto
 - buildroot (kind of)

## Specific

I have a Seeed Studio ReTerminal, raspberry pi, Beaglebone black, and a Beaglebone green gateway so mostly targeted towards those.

As of now, kirkstone is the current yocto, I think. So, builds that.

## How to use

Just use the Makefile. That's really the documentation. Which sucks.
